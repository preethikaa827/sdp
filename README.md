#‚ú® **GPT-2 Text Generation Playground**
This project demonstrates how to use pre-trained transformer models to generate coherent and creative text using Python and the transformers library. It's a fun and easy way to explore the power of AI in text generation!

üöÄ **Features**
Pre-trained Model: Utilizes GPT-2 (or its smaller version distilgpt2) for generating human-like text based on a given prompt.
Customizable Output: Configure output length, temperature, and repetition constraints to tailor the creativity of the generated text.
Simple and Efficient: Leverages PyTorch and Hugging Face‚Äôs transformers library for seamless interaction with state-of-the-art models.

üõ†Ô∏è **Setup**
1. Install the required libraries:
Make sure you have Python installed. Then, run the following command in your terminal:

bash
Copy code
pip install transformers torch
2. Clone or Copy the Script:
Copy the script or clone the project repository to your local system.

üß† **How It Works**
Load the Model: The script loads GPT-2, a robust pre-trained language model.
Tokenization: Converts your input prompt into tokens that the model understands.
Generate Text: The model generates a continuation of your input prompt based on its learned patterns.
Decode: Converts the generated tokens back into human-readable text.

**üìú Usage**
Define Your Prompt
Modify the prompt variable to input the text you'd like the model to continue. For example:

python
Copy code
prompt = "Once upon a time in a futuristic city,"
Call the generate_content Function
Run the script and use the generate_content function to get your generated text:

python
Copy code
output = generate_content(prompt, max_length=150)
print(output)
Example Output:
Input:

text
Copy code
"Once upon a time in a futuristic city,"
Output:

text
Copy code
"Once upon a time in a futuristic city, a young engineer named Alex discovered an abandoned robot factory. Inside, they found a robot named Nova, who held the secrets to saving the city from an impending disaster."
‚ú® Customization
max_length: Adjust the length of the output text.
temperature: Control the randomness of the output (lower for more deterministic, higher for more creative).
no_repeat_ngram_size: Prevent repetitive phrases by setting this parameter.

Use Control + Shift + m to toggle the tab key moving focus. Alternatively, use esc then tab to move to the next interactive element on the page.
